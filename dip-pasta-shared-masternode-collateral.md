## Abstract

This DIP extends [DIP-0003: Deterministic Masternode Lists](dip-0003.md) and
[DIP-0026: Masternode Multi-Party Payouts](dip-0026.md) to allow 2 to 8
participants to trustlessly co-own a single masternode. The participants fund
the collateral atomically in one registration transaction, consensus splits the
owner reward across the participants in proportion to their recorded
contributions, and the collateral can leave the masternode only through a
consensus-enforced dissolution that pays each participant's principal to a
refund script recorded at registration. No participant, operator, miner, or
compromised update path can redirect another participant's principal, and no
participant can be prevented from exiting.

## Motivation

DIP-0026 provides protocol-enforced recurring reward splitting, but it
explicitly leaves the registrar owner in control of the payout list and does
not protect the collateral UTXO from unilateral spending. Its Security
Considerations section notes that "a share arrangement that requires immutable
payout rights must use additional contractual, wallet, or protocol mechanisms
outside the scope of this DIP." This DIP is that protocol mechanism.

Without it, shared masternode ownership requires trusting a collateral holder:
whoever controls the collateral key can spend the collateral, destroy the
masternode, and abscond with the other participants' principal. Pre-signed
multi-signature refund transactions cannot fix this on Dash: without SegWit or
Taproot, a co-signer can malleate the funding transaction identifier and
invalidate every pre-signed child. The only robust construction available is a
consensus-enforced covenant: the protocol itself records each participant's
contribution, refund script, reward script, and owner key, and enforces
refunds, rewards, and update consent directly.

This DIP is therefore a strict superset of DIP-0026:

* DIP-0026: protocol-enforced recurring reward split;
* this DIP: protocol-enforced funding, reward split, update consent, and
  trustless exit.

## Specification

### Terminology

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Participant | One of the 2 to 8 co-owners of a shared masternode. |
| Share | One participant's recorded collateral contribution and associated scripts and key. |
| Share table | The ordered list of shares recorded at registration. Order is consensus-significant. |
| Refund script | The immutable script a participant's principal is paid to at dissolution. |
| Reward script | The script a participant's portion of owner rewards is paid to. Participant-updatable. |
| Share owner key | The ECDSA key (as a key ID) that authorizes a participant's consensus actions. Immutable. |
| Early period | The first `earlyPeriodBlocks` blocks after registration, during which unilateral exit is penalized. |
| Dissolution | The consensus-enforced spend of shared collateral that refunds all participants and removes the masternode. |
| Actor | The participant designated by `actorIndex` in a dissolution; pays the penalty (if any) and the transaction fee. |
| Unilateral dissolution | A dissolution authorized by exactly one participant. |
| Unanimous dissolution | A dissolution authorized by every participant. |

### Provider Transaction Version

This DIP extends the version 3 (extended addresses) ProRegTx payload, which
carries the DIP-0026 `payouts` field, prior to its release in any Dash Core
version. DIP-0026's multi-party payouts were originally specified as a separate
version 4 (`MultiPayout`); because both versions are introduced by the same
deployment, the reference implementation folded version 4 into version 3, and
this DIP follows that layout. A version 3 ProRegTx with a non-zero
`sharesCount` is a **shared registration**. A version 3 ProRegTx with
`sharesCount = 0` behaves exactly as specified in DIP-0026.

Because version 3 has not been released, the additional fields below change the
serialization of all version 3 ProRegTx payloads (a non-shared payload still
serializes `sharesCount = 0`, an empty share list, and zeroed penalty fields).
This DIP and DIP-0026 must therefore deploy in the same release.

### Shared Collateral Script

The collateral output of a shared registration must use exactly the following
7-byte script (the **template**):

```text
0x04 "DSHC" OP_DROP OP_TRUE
hex: 04445348437551
```

Template matching is always **exact-script** comparison against these 7 bytes,
never prefix matching.

The template contains no keys and is spendable with an empty `scriptSig` at the
script layer. All protection comes from the following consensus rules, active
from deployment activation:

* **Creation:** an output whose `scriptPubKey` equals the template is valid
  only as the collateral output of a valid shared registration. Any other
  creation — in a normal transaction, a coinbase, another special transaction,
  or a non-collateral output of the registration itself — is invalid.
* **Spending:** a transaction spending an output whose `scriptPubKey` equals
  the template is valid only if it is a valid ProDisTx whose referenced
  masternode owns that outpoint.

A template output mined before activation (necessarily created deliberately,
against a pattern reserved by this published DIP, and nonstandard to relay)
becomes permanently unspendable at activation. This follows the established
reserved-pattern upgrade path and affects only coins whose owner explicitly
opted in.

### Collateral Share

Each share has the following structure:

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| amount | int64_t | 8 | Collateral contribution in duffs. |
| refundScriptSize | compactSize uint | 1-9 | Size of the refund script. |
| refundScript | Script | Variable | Immutable principal refund script (P2PKH/P2SH). |
| rewardScriptSize | compactSize uint | 1-9 | Size of the reward script. |
| rewardScript | Script | Variable | Reward payout script (P2PKH/P2SH). Zero length means "use refundScript". |
| ownerKeyID | CKeyID | 20 | Immutable share owner key ID. |

For shared registrations, the following fields are appended to the version 3
ProRegTx payload immediately after the `payouts` field defined in DIP-0026:

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sharesCount | uint8_t | 1 | Number of shares. 0 = not shared; otherwise 2 to 8. |
| shares | CollateralShare[] | Variable | The share table, in consensus-significant order. |
| joinSigs | signature[sharesCount] | 65 * sharesCount | One registration consent signature per share, in share order. |
| earlyPeriodBlocks | uint32_t | 4 | Length of the early period in blocks. |
| earlyPenalty | int64_t | 8 | Penalty in duffs for unilateral dissolution during the early period. |

All signatures introduced by this DIP (`joinSigs` and ProDisTx signatures) are
65-byte compact recoverable ECDSA signatures with **enforced low-S** (the
signature scheme used for owner-key payload signatures in DIP-0003). High-S
signatures are invalid. This, combined with the digest rules below, makes the
affected transaction identifiers non-malleable by third parties.

### Registering a Shared Masternode

A shared registration (version 3 ProRegTx, `sharesCount > 0`) is valid only if
all of the following hold, in addition to DIP-0003 rules not explicitly
replaced here:

1. The deployment (see [Deployment and Compatibility](#deployment-and-compatibility))
   is active.
2. `type` is 0 (Regular masternode). Shared Evo masternodes are out of scope
   (see [Rationale](#rationale)).
3. The collateral is internal: `collateralOutpoint.hash` is null and
   `collateralOutpoint.n` points at an output of this transaction whose value
   equals the required collateral and whose `scriptPubKey` is exactly the
   template.
4. The DIP-0026 `payouts` list is empty (owner rewards derive from the share
   table) and the legacy `scriptPayout` is absent per version 3.
5. `keyIdOwner` is all zeros. The share owner keys replace it.
6. `sharesCount` is between 2 and 8 inclusive.
7. Every share `amount` is at least 100 DASH, and the amounts sum exactly to
   the required collateral.
8. `0 <= earlyPenalty < min(share amounts)`, and `earlyPeriodBlocks` does not
   exceed 420480 blocks (approximately two years at 2.5-minute blocks).
9. No two shares have the same `ownerKeyID`; no share `ownerKeyID` equals any
   owner key registered by any other masternode (see
   [Masternode List State](#masternode-list-state)); duplicate `refundScript`s
   within the share table are invalid; duplicate `rewardScript`s are allowed.
10. No `refundScript` or `rewardScript` pays P2PK or P2PKH to any share
    `ownerKeyID` in the table or to `keyIdVoting` (extends the DIP-0026
    payee-reuse rules), and none equals the template
    (see [Forbidden Template Destinations](#forbidden-template-destinations)).
11. The external-collateral `payloadSig` is empty, and each entry of `joinSigs`
    is a valid canonical signature by the corresponding share's `ownerKeyID`
    over `SharedRegConsentHash`.

`SharedRegConsentHash` is the double-SHA256 of the serialization of:

```text
"DashSharedMNReg" || payload version ||
tx version || tx type || tx nLockTime ||
inputsHash || all input sequences || outputsHash ||
type || mode || netInfo and Platform fields ||
keyIdVoting || pubKeyOperator || operatorReward ||
shares || earlyPeriodBlocks || earlyPenalty
```

where `inputsHash` and `outputsHash` are as defined in DIP-0003, and `shares`
is the serialized share table. Consent therefore binds every participant to the
exact funding inputs (prevouts and sequences), all outputs (including the
collateral output and every change output), the full share table, the penalty
terms, and the registrar configuration. Consent never relies on the sighash
modes of funding-input signatures, because Dash transaction signatures permit
`SIGHASH_NONE`, `SIGHASH_SINGLE`, and `SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY`. Covering the
input sequences matters: BIP68 gives them consensus meaning on version 2 and
later transactions, so an uncovered sequence rewrite between consent signing
and funding-input signing could impose a months-long relative timelock on a
fully consented registration.

Registration is atomic: if any funding input is double-spent or any participant
withholds a `joinSig`, no shared masternode is created and no participant's
funds move. Co-signer transaction-identifier malleability is harmless: nothing
is pre-signed against the registration txid, and the consent digest binds to
prevouts, sequences, and outputs, which malleation cannot change.

### Dissolving a Shared Masternode (ProDisTx)

This DIP introduces a new special transaction type:

| Name | Special transaction type |
| --- | --- |
| ProDisTx | 10 |

Payload:

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| version | uint16_t | 2 | Payload version. Currently 1. |
| proTxHash | uint256 | 32 | The ProRegTx hash of the shared masternode. |
| actorIndex | uint16_t | 2 | Index into the share table of the actor. |
| sigCount | uint8_t | 1 | Number of signatures: exactly 1 (unilateral) or exactly `sharesCount` (unanimous). |
| sigs | signature[sigCount] | 65 * sigCount | Canonical signatures over `SharedDisHash`. |

There is no mode field: **the signature count defines the mode**. Exactly one
signature — which must be by `shares[actorIndex].ownerKeyID` — is a unilateral
dissolution. Exactly `sharesCount` signatures — one per share, in share order —
is a unanimous dissolution. Any other count, order, or signer set is invalid.
The signature count is committed into `SharedDisHash` (below), so the mode is
bound into every signature: a third party cannot reinterpret a penalty-free
unanimous dissolution as a unilateral one (or vice versa) by dropping or adding
signatures, which would otherwise leave the inputs and outputs unchanged but
alter the transaction identifier.

A ProDisTx must have exactly one input: the masternode's collateral outpoint,
with an empty `scriptSig`. It must have no outputs other than those required
below.

`SharedDisHash` is the double-SHA256 of the serialization of:

```text
"DashSharedMNDissolve" || payload version ||
tx version || tx type || tx nLockTime ||
all input prevouts || all input sequences || all outputs ||
proTxHash || actorIndex || sigCount
```

The digest commits to the transaction's actual input and outputs directly; the
payload deliberately carries no `inputsHash`/`outputsHash` copies. It also
commits to `sigCount`, which selects the mode, so the unilateral/unanimous
distinction cannot be malleated after signing.

#### Required penalty

```text
early = (spendHeight - registeredHeight) < earlyPeriodBlocks
requiredPenalty = (unanimous or not early) ? 0 : earlyPenalty
```

`spendHeight` is the height of the block containing the ProDisTx and
`registeredHeight` is the masternode's registration height. `requiredPenalty`
can only step from `earlyPenalty` to zero as the chain advances, so it is
non-increasing in `spendHeight`.

#### Output rules

All output rules are **minimum-based**: paying more penalty than required is
always valid. Because `requiredPenalty` is non-increasing, a ProDisTx that is
valid at height `h` is valid at every height `h' >= h`: no dissolution is
silently invalidated by chain progress. The converse is intentionally not true:
a unilateral ProDisTx paying no penalty is invalid until the early period ends.

Let `a = actorIndex`, `W` = the sum of non-actor share amounts, and
`P = requiredPenalty`. A ProDisTx is valid only if:

1. `actorIndex < sharesCount`.
2. There is exactly one output per non-actor share `i`, paying
   `shares[i].refundScript`, in share order, plus optionally one final output
   paying `shares[a].refundScript` (the actor output). A zero-value actor
   output must be omitted. No other outputs are permitted.
3. For each non-actor output, with `bonus[i] = value[i] - shares[i].amount`:
   `bonus[i] >= floor(P * shares[i].amount / W)`.
4. The sum of all `bonus[i]` is at least `P`.

Everything not paid to these outputs is the transaction fee, which by value
conservation can only come from the actor's share; the actor output is
therefore implicitly capped at `shares[a].amount - P`.

The per-recipient minimum in rule 3 uses a plain floor with no remainder
assignment: floors are element-wise monotone in `P`, whereas any remainder
assignment rule is not, and would break monotone validity. Rule 4 forces the
sub-duff remainder onto some non-actor output. The pro-rata floors also prevent
the actor from concentrating the penalty into a colluding share beyond rounding
dust. Constructors should build outputs with the same sequential-floor,
remainder-to-last convention that DIP-0026 uses for rewards; that construction
always satisfies the minimums.

When a valid ProDisTx is confirmed, the masternode is removed from the
deterministic masternode list. Confirmed reward-script or registrar updates
never invalidate a pending ProDisTx (its digest references none of those
fields); the only transaction that can displace a pending ProDisTx is a
competing ProDisTx, which conflicts on the collateral input.

#### Fees and standby dissolutions (non-normative)

Dash relay supports neither BIP125 replacement nor package relay, so a ProDisTx
must embed a sufficient fee at signing time; child-pays-for-parent on the actor
output can only raise the mining priority of a ProDisTx that already meets the
minimum relay fee. A flat fee of roughly 100000 duffs — about one millionth of
the minimum share — provides large fee-market headroom. Because Dash relay has
no replacement mechanism, the first ProDisTx to reach the mempool for a given
collateral wins; a competing ProDisTx conflicts on the collateral input and is
rejected until the first is mined or dropped.

Because validity is monotone and share owner keys are immutable, a signed
ProDisTx never goes stale. Wallets should have each participant sign a
**standby dissolution** immediately after registration confirms — unilateral,
paying `earlyPenalty` (valid immediately and forever) or no penalty (valid from
the end of the early period, forever) — and store it with the participant's
refund-key backup, separately from the owner key. If the owner key is later
lost, broadcasting the standby recovers the participant's principal without any
other party's cooperation. A leaked standby is griefing-only: every output is
covenant-fixed, so its holder can trigger the exit (costing the signer the
penalty) but cannot redirect any value.

### Updating a Share (ProUpShareTx)

| Name | Special transaction type |
| --- | --- |
| ProUpShareTx | 11 |

Payload:

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| version | uint16_t | 2 | Payload version. Currently 1. |
| proTxHash | uint256 | 32 | The ProRegTx hash of the shared masternode. |
| shareIndex | uint16_t | 2 | Index into the share table of the share being updated. |
| rewardScriptSize | compactSize uint | 1-9 | Size of the new reward script. |
| rewardScript | Script | Variable | New reward script (P2PKH/P2SH), or zero length for "use refundScript". |
| inputsHash | uint256 | 32 | Hash of all transaction inputs, as in DIP-0003 update payloads. |
| payloadSig | signature | 65 | Canonical signature by `shares[shareIndex].ownerKeyID` over the payload hash (with this field empty). |

A ProUpShareTx updates exactly one share's `rewardScript` and nothing else.
Share `amount`, `refundScript`, `ownerKeyID`, the participant count, the
penalty, and the early period are immutable for the life of the masternode. The
new reward script is subject to the same script-type, payee-reuse, and template
restrictions as at registration. A ProUpShareTx referencing a non-shared
masternode is invalid.

### Updating the Shared Registrar (ProUpSharedRegTx)

| Name | Special transaction type |
| --- | --- |
| ProUpSharedRegTx | 12 |

Payload:

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| version | uint16_t | 2 | Payload version. Currently 1. |
| proTxHash | uint256 | 32 | The ProRegTx hash of the shared masternode. |
| pubKeyOperator | BLSPubKey | 48 | New operator public key. |
| keyIdVoting | CKeyID | 20 | New voting key ID. |
| inputsHash | uint256 | 32 | Hash of all transaction inputs, as in DIP-0003 update payloads. |
| sigCount | uint8_t | 1 | Must equal `sharesCount`. |
| sigs | signature[sigCount] | 65 * sigCount | Canonical signatures over the payload hash (with this field empty), one per share, in share order. |

A ProUpSharedRegTx updates the whole-masternode registrar fields and requires
one valid signature from **every** current share owner key, in share order.
Operator-key change semantics (service reset) match ProUpRegTx in DIP-0003. A
ProUpSharedRegTx referencing a non-shared masternode is invalid, and a plain
ProUpRegTx referencing a shared masternode is invalid.

The operator reward is fixed at registration and is not updatable, matching the
DIP-0003 ProUpRegTx model (where `operatorReward` is likewise immutable after
registration); it is therefore not carried in this payload.

Operator-authorized updates are unchanged: the operator continues to manage
service fields via ProUpServTx (including the operator payout script) and may
revoke via ProUpRevTx. The operator can stop service but cannot spend
collateral, redirect owner rewards, or rewrite ownership.

### Masternode List State

Deterministic masternode state for a shared masternode must store the share
table (without `joinSigs`, which are needed only at registration validation),
`earlyPeriodBlocks`, and `earlyPenalty`. State diffs must report the share
table as a single logical field: any change to a mutable share field includes
the full replacement share table.

Owner-key uniqueness is enforced across the whole masternode list in both
directions: a share `ownerKeyID` must not equal any other masternode's
registered owner key (shared or `keyIdOwner`), and a normal registration must
not reuse any active share owner key.

Share data is excluded from the simplified masternode list entry hash
(`CSimplifiedMNListEntry`), matching DIP-0026's treatment of payout data.
Extended JSON forms may expose shares for diagnostics; this is not a
light-client commitment. Full nodes validate shared rewards and dissolutions
from deterministic masternode state reconstructed from blocks.

### Masternode Reward Payments

Reward payment construction for a shared masternode follows the DIP-0026
procedure exactly, with the owner payout entries derived from the share table:

* the entry ordering is the share-table order;
* the entry weight is the share `amount` (instead of basis points), so entry
  `i` (except the last) receives `floor(ownerReward * amount[i] / collateral)`
  and the last entry receives the remainder;
* the entry destination is the share's `rewardScript` if non-empty, otherwise
  its `refundScript`;
* zero-amount outputs are omitted, and operator reward handling is unchanged.

This reuses DIP-0026's single rounding convention (sequential floor, remainder
to the last entry) rather than introducing a second one.

### Collateral Spend Enforcement

Template rules cannot live only inside provider-transaction checks. Consensus
implementations must enforce, at both mempool acceptance and block connection:

1. **Spend check:** for every transaction, if any input's previous output
   script equals the template, the transaction must be a valid ProDisTx
   spending that outpoint. This is a constant exact-script comparison per
   input; the masternode list is consulted only inside ProDisTx validation.
2. **Creation check:** any transaction output whose script equals the template,
   outside the collateral slot of a valid shared registration, is invalid.
3. A ProDisTx is validated against the deterministic masternode list as of
   the previous block, in blocks exactly as in the mempool. Registering and
   dissolving the same masternode within one block is invalid. Everything a
   dissolution is validated against (refund scripts, amounts, registration
   height) is immutable after registration, so this single validation context
   is complete and block validation reuses the mempool path.
4. Masternode removal for a shared masternode occurs only through a validated
   ProDisTx. Collateral-spend removal semantics for normal masternodes are
   unchanged (normal collateral never carries the template).
5. A validated ProDisTx removes its masternode in the same collateral-spend
   phase of deterministic-list construction as an ordinary collateral spend —
   that is, after all of the block's provider transactions have been applied.
   A shared masternode update (ProUpShareTx or ProUpSharedRegTx) and a
   dissolution of the same masternode may therefore appear together in one
   block in either order: the update always applies before the removal takes
   effect.

Mempool implementations should additionally evict pending ProUpShareTx and
ProUpSharedRegTx transactions for a masternode when its ProDisTx confirms.

### Forbidden Template Destinations

Because template outputs may only be created inside shared registrations, any
consensus-mandated output paying the template would be unconstructable and
could deadlock consensus. Validation must therefore reject the template script
wherever a user-supplied script later becomes a consensus-mandated output:

* share `refundScript` and `rewardScript` values (registration and
  ProUpShareTx) — a template refund script would make every dissolution
  invalid, freezing the collateral forever;
* every provider-transaction payout script for every masternode type and
  payload version, including DIP-0026 payout entries and the operator payout
  script — a template payout would make the coinbase unconstructable when that
  masternode is paid;
* governance proposal and trigger payment scripts (validated after
  activation) — a template payee would invalidate the superblock carrying it;
* asset-unlock (credit withdrawal) destinations — a template destination would
  make the withdrawal transaction invalid.

### Special Transaction Filtering

A shared **registration** carries the full share table, so special transaction
filters and bloom filters must match it on every share `refundScript`,
`rewardScript`, and `ownerKeyID`, in the same manner that DIP-0026 requires for
payout scripts.

The lifecycle transactions do not carry the share table — only the `proTxHash`
identifying the masternode — so, consistent with the DIP-0003 treatment of
ProUpRegTx and ProUpRevTx, they are matched by `proTxHash` (plus the new
`rewardScript` for ProUpShareTx). A light client learns a masternode's share
scripts and owner keys from the registration it matched, then follows that
masternode's lifecycle by its `proTxHash`. Two properties make this sufficient
in practice: the refund and reward payments produced by a ProDisTx are ordinary
transaction outputs, matched by script in the base filter, so a client watching
its refund or reward script sees its funds without any special-transaction
logic; and a BIP37 bloom filter with `BLOOM_UPDATE_ALL` inserts the `proTxHash`
automatically when it matches the registration, so an owner-key watcher receives
subsequent lifecycle transactions without further configuration.

Requiring stateless filters to match the lifecycle transactions on the share
`ownerKeyID`s is not possible, because those transactions do not contain the
keys and filter construction performs no masternode-list lookup.

## Deployment and Compatibility

This DIP deploys with Dash Core's v24 network upgrade (`DEPLOYMENT_V24`,
an Enhanced Hard Fork per [DIP-0023](dip-0023.md)), together with DIP-0026.

Before activation:

* Shared registrations, ProDisTx, ProUpShareTx, and ProUpSharedRegTx are
  invalid.
* Creating template-scripted outputs is nonstandard but not consensus-invalid.

After activation:

* All rules in this DIP apply.
* Template outputs created before activation are permanently unspendable.
* Existing masternodes (legacy and version 3 non-shared) are unaffected.
  Normal masternode collateral-spend semantics are unchanged.

Shared registration is restricted to Regular masternodes in this version.
Extending shared ownership to Evo masternodes requires a Platform-side
specification for distributing Platform credits according to the share table;
without it, Platform-side rewards would not follow the consensus split and
would reintroduce the trust this DIP removes.

## Rationale

### Why a consensus covenant instead of multi-signature scripts

Dash lacks SegWit and Taproot, so transaction identifiers are malleable by
co-signers and pre-signed refund transactions are unsafe. A P2SH multi-sig
collateral script would additionally freeze funds if signers disappear and
cannot express per-participant refund amounts. Recording ownership in the
provider payload and enforcing spends in consensus — the same trust model as
DIP-0003's deterministic masternode lists — avoids both problems. The price is
that the collateral output is anyone-can-spend at the script layer on any chain
that does not enforce these rules; see
[Security Considerations](#security-considerations).

### Why the template is pattern-restricted on both creation and spend

Restricting creation makes the template a trustworthy marker: after activation,
every template output is live shared collateral. Restricting spending by
pattern (rather than by masternode-list lookup) makes the per-input hook a
constant script comparison and closes every path to such an output. Freezing
the (deliberately created, nonstandard) pre-activation outputs follows the
SegWit reserved-pattern precedent and affects only opt-in coins. Exact-script
matching keeps the reserved set to a single 7-byte script.

### Why share owner keys cannot be rotated

Rotation authorization would rest on the very key being replaced, so under key
compromise rotation is first-mover-wins: a thief who rotates first locks the
honest participant out of their own share permanently. With immutable keys,
compromise is a standoff in which the honest holder always retains the right to
dissolve, and principal is protected by the immutable refund script in every
scenario. Share owner keys sign only rare deliberate events and should be held
in cold storage; custody migration uses a penalty-free unanimous dissolution
followed by re-registration. Immutability also makes dissolution validity
unconditional: no confirmed transaction can stale a pending ProDisTx's
signatures.

### Why dissolution outputs are minimum-based

Exact-amount output rules would make a unilateral ProDisTx signed near the
early-period boundary silently consensus-invalid one block later (the required
penalty changes with height, so the exact amounts change). Minimum-based rules
with a non-increasing required penalty make validity monotone: once valid,
always valid. This property is also what makes standby dissolutions safe to
sign years in advance.

### Why the penalty is redistributed rather than burned or waived

Redistribution compensates remaining participants for losing their node and
payment-queue position. Burning would punish the innocent majority to deny a
hypothetical griefer a small bonus. A penalty waiver triggered by sustained
PoSe ban was considered and rejected: the operator controls PoSe status, and in
practice a participant is often the operator, so a waiver lets a participant
deliberately get the node banned and exit penalty-free during the early period,
converting "the leaver compensates the others" into "everyone loses". There is
exactly one penalty and it applies only to unilateral exits during the early
period; free exit afterwards is structural.

### Why the mode is derived from the signature count

A ProDisTx with one signature is unilateral; with all `sharesCount` signatures
it is unanimous. An explicit mode byte would be redundant with the signature
count and require a consistency cross-check. Both modes share one output-rule
regime because the minimum-based rules degenerate cleanly to
"each participant receives at least their share" when the required penalty is
zero.

### Why this extends provider transaction version 3

Version 3 (extended addresses, which carries DIP-0026's payouts after the
version 4 fold) has not shipped, so folding shared collateral into the same
version avoids an additional version solely for field layering, at the cost of
a wire-format change to an unreleased payload version. The two DIPs deploy
together in v24.

### Bounds

Two to eight participants matches the DIP-0026 payout-entry cap and bounds
coinbase fan-out and masternode state size. The 100 DASH minimum share keeps
shares meaningful and bounds fragmentation. The two-year cap on the early
period prevents unbounded penalty windows. `earlyPenalty < min(share amounts)`
guarantees the actor a positive remainder, so a dissolution can always pay its
own fee.

## Test Cases

Implementations should include tests for at least the following:

1. A valid shared registration with 2 and with 8 participants.
2. Invalid: shared Evo registration; external shared collateral; share sum not
   equal to the collateral; share below 100 DASH; `earlyPenalty >= min(share)`;
   early period above the cap; non-empty DIP-0026 `payouts` with shares;
   non-zero `keyIdOwner`.
3. Invalid: duplicate share owner key within the table or across masternodes
   (both directions with normal masternodes); duplicate refund scripts;
   refund or reward script paying P2PKH to any share owner key or the voting
   key; refund or reward script equal to the template.
4. Invalid: missing or non-canonical (high-S) `joinSig`; consent digest
   mismatch after changing any covered field.
5. Invalid: any normal transaction spending a template output; post-activation
   template-output creation in a normal transaction, a coinbase, or a
   non-collateral output of a shared registration. A near-miss script (template
   plus or minus a byte) is unrestricted. A pre-activation template output is
   permanently unspendable.
6. Valid: unilateral dissolution during the early period paying `earlyPenalty`;
   unilateral dissolution after the early period paying no penalty; a
   dissolution signed during the early period confirming after the boundary
   (monotonicity); overpaying the penalty; unanimous dissolution paying no
   penalty at any height.
7. Invalid: unilateral dissolution paying no penalty inside the early period;
   any per-recipient floor violation; bonus sum below the required penalty;
   redirected or reordered refund outputs; extra outputs; extra inputs;
   non-empty `scriptSig` on the collateral input; wrong actor signature;
   signature count other than 1 or `sharesCount`; unanimous signatures out of
   share order.
8. Invalid: registration and dissolution of the same masternode within one
   block (a dissolution is valid only once its registration is contained in a
   prior block).
9. A pending dissolution remains valid across confirming ProUpShareTx and
   ProUpSharedRegTx transactions; a standby dissolution signed at registration
   broadcasts successfully after the early-period boundary.
10. ProUpShareTx updates exactly one reward script with the correct single
    signature; invalid for wrong signer, non-shared masternode, or any attempt
    to alter immutable fields. ProUpSharedRegTx requires all signatures in
    share order; plain ProUpRegTx is invalid for a shared masternode.
11. Reward split across mined blocks: conservation, remainder to the last
    entry, zero-output omission, operator reward interaction, reward script
    fallback to refund script.
12. Reorg across registration, across the early-period boundary, and across
    update-then-dissolution ordering; restart from a deterministic masternode
    list snapshot before and after shared state changes.
13. Filter matching for every share refund script, reward script, and owner
    key.

## Security Considerations

**Non-enforcing chains.** The template is anyone-can-spend at the script layer.
On any chain that does not enforce this DIP — non-upgraded software, a chain
split, a hypothetical future consensus regression — shared collateral outputs
are freely spendable. The protection is the hard fork itself: theft can only
"succeed" on chains that are economically meaningless to the participants. This
trade-off is inherent to consensus covenants on a chain without script-level
covenant support and must be accepted with eyes open.

**Key separation.** The share owner key is control plane, never a fund
destination. The central guarantee — owner-key compromise cannot steal
principal — holds only because the refund destination is independent of the
owner key: a thief who dissolves as the victim still pays the principal to a
script they cannot spend. This is why refund and reward scripts must not pay to
share owner keys, and why wallets must not derive refund destinations from
owner keys even in forms consensus cannot detect (such as inside P2SH).

**Key compromise.** A stolen share owner key allows redirecting that share's
future rewards and triggering a penalized unilateral dissolution — never
principal theft. Because keys cannot be rotated, victim and thief hold
identical capabilities; the honest holder always retains the exit right.

**Key loss.** Principal is never endangered: any other participant's unilateral
dissolution refunds the key-less participant in full, and outside the early
period this costs the rescuer only the transaction fee. A key-less participant
cannot force exit, one lost key permanently disables the unanimous and
whole-masternode update paths, and losing all owner keys freezes the collateral
forever. Standby dissolutions (see above) reduce all of these to "keep your
standby with your refund-key backup".

**Hostage and griefing dynamics.** A participant who refuses to sign
whole-masternode updates can degrade the node (for example, blocking operator
key replacement), and an honest leaver both pays the early penalty and pays a
pro-rata slice of it to the obstructive participant. This is bounded: the
initially configured operator key keeps working indefinitely, exit after the
early period is penalty-free, and the early penalty is a term every participant
consented to at formation. Wallets must present penalty terms prominently, and
must warn that a zero `earlyPenalty` permits cheap early griefing.

**Transaction-identifier malleability.** The covenant input's empty-`scriptSig`
rule and the low-S requirement on all payload signatures pin every free byte of
a ProDisTx; inputs, sequences, outputs, and lock time are covered by the signed
digest. Without these rules, third parties could mutate a pending dissolution's
txid, breaking child-pays-for-parent fee bumps.

**Forbidden destinations.** The list in
[Forbidden Template Destinations](#forbidden-template-destinations) is
consensus-critical: missing any entry creates either permanently frozen
collateral or an unconstructable coinbase (a consensus deadlock) via a crafted
script.

## Privacy Considerations

Shared ownership is consensus-visible by construction:

* the share table — amounts, owner key IDs, refund scripts, reward scripts, and
  penalty terms — is public on-chain forever;
* every payout block creates up to 8 owner outputs that persistently cluster
  the co-owners' scripts with each other and with the masternode;
* the immutable refund script is an address pre-commitment made years before
  the exit that eventually pays it.

Wallets should use fresh keys and destinations for every formation, never reuse
a refund destination across formations or with other on-chain activity, and may
rotate reward scripts freely. Participants who want unlinkability between their
share and their other funds must break the link before funding (for example,
by mixing the funding inputs); note that refunds return as large,
non-denominated outputs.
